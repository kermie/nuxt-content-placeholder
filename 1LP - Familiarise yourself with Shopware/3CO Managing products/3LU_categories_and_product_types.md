### Sales Channels

In Shopware, the most basic concept of how products are displayed to the visitor of the website is Sales Channels. The technical concept and the features will be explained in-depth in another lesson. It's important to understand that each sales channel is mapped to a certain domain, subdomain or URL.

If you run multiple Sales Channels you can define, which products are shown in it. Also, the language and design of the store can be indivivual for every Sales Channel you create. Meaning, Shopware can handle multiple stores for one catalogue of products.

### Defining categories

Most likely, you would start with defining the categories. Please have in mind, that for (psycho-)logical and SEO reasons, categories are not necessarily have to map the merchandize groups of the manufacturer.

An example: let's say, you are selling furnishing fabrics. It doesn't make sense to categorize them as your supplier would do. He would give you merchandize groups, for example, devided into the weight of the fabric. But none of your prospect clients would find you on the Internet nor find what is right for him in your store. Instead, consider renaming and re-grouping your categories into **fabric for the living room**, **bathroom curtains**, and so on.

### Entering products

The next step is to enter products and assign them to your categories. Shopware allows you to use several types of products.

Think of

* regular physical products
* products with variants (one cannot sell a t-shirt without a size and a color)
* intengable products like learning courses or even
* digital products (AKA downloadable products) such as music, software, etc.

Before starting to enter products, make sure you thought about what kind of products you want to sell. For several reasons, it doesn't make sense to enter different variants which only devite by color, size, weight or price as regular physical product each. Instead, consider to group them in products with variants and let the client decide which "flavor" of this product he wants to purchase.

#### Automatic imports

If you want to import or automatically alter your products via the built in import function of Shopware or via an interface to your ERP or PIM system, think about the structure carefully and prepare your data-to-import accordingly.

Now you are ready to enter your first products, innit? How to do that exactly? This is already well-described in our [user documentation](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/catalogues).
